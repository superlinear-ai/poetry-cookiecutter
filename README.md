# ☄️ UV Copier Template

A modern [Copier template](https://github.com/copier-org/copier) for scaffolding Python packages and apps.

<!-- TODO: Remove the Demo section below with a mp4 demo.

## 🍿 Demo

See 👖 [Conformal Tights](https://github.com/superlinear-ai/conformal-tights) for an example of a Python package that is scaffolded with this template. Contributing to this package can be done with a single click by [starting a GitHub Codespace](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=765698489&skip_quickstart=true) or [starting a Dev Container](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/superlinear-ai/conformal-tights).

## ✨ Using

> [!TIP]
> You should first [install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to be able to run the commands below.

### Create a new Python project

To create a new Python project with this template, run:

```sh
uvx copier copy gh:superlinear-ai/uv-copier-template path/to/local/repository
```

### Update your Python project

To update your Python project to the latest template version, run:

```sh
uvx copier update
```

### Release a new version of your Python project

If you have enabled [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), you can create a new version tag and update `CHANGELOG.md` based on your commit messages with:

```sh
git checkout main
cz bump
git push origin main --tags
```

## 🌱 Migrating from Cookiecutter

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project was formerly known as `Poetry Cookiecutter` and was based on [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) and [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter). We will continue to support the original Cookiecutter-based template side by side with the new Copier-based template. However, we do encourage users to upgrade to the new Copier-based template by following the instructions below.

To migrate a project from Cookiecutter to Copier, follow these steps:

1. In your project repository, run:

    ```sh
    # Create a new branch
    git checkout -b rescaffold
    
    # Rescaffold the project without changing src/ and tests/
    uvx copier copy --overwrite --exclude src/ --exclude tests/ gh:superlinear-ai/uv-copier-template .
    ```

2. Review the changes to `pyproject.toml` and reinsert your project's dependencies.
3. Review the changes to `README.md` and reinsert your project's documentation.
4. Commit all and push all changes with:

    ```sh
    # Stage all changes
    git add .

    # Commit the staged changes
    git commit -m "build: upgrade scaffolding"

    # Push the committed changes
    git push origin rescaffold
    ```

5. Create a PR from your branch, review it, and merge it!
