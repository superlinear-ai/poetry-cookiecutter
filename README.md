## ‚ú® Using

### Creating a new Python project

To create a new Python project with this template:

1. Install the latest [Cruft](https://github.com/cruft/cruft) and [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) in your [Python environment](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv) with:

   ```sh
   pip install --upgrade "cruft>=2.12.0" "cookiecutter>=2.1.1"
   ```

2. [Create a new repository](https://github.com/new) for your Python project, then clone it locally.
3. Run the following command in the parent directory of the cloned repository to apply the Poetry Cookiecutter template:

   ```sh
   cruft create -f https://github.com/radix-ai/poetry-cookiecutter
   ```

   <details>

   <summary>‚ö†Ô∏è If your repository name ‚â† the project's slugified name</summary>

   If your repository name differs from your project's slugified name (see `project_name` in the [Template parameters](https://github.com/radix-ai/poetry-cookiecutter#-template-parameters) below), you will need to copy the scaffolded project into the repository with:

      ```sh
      cp -r {project-name}/ {repository-name}/
      ```

   </details>

### Updating your Python project

To update your Python project to the latest template version:

1. Update the project while verifying the existing template parameters and setting any new parameters, if there are any:

   ```sh
   cruft update --cookiecutter-input
   ```

2. If any of the file updates failed, resolve them by inspecting the corresponding `.rej` files.
