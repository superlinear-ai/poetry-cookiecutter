## ‚ú® Using

> [!TIP]
> You should first [install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to be able to run the commands below.

### Create a new Python project

To create a new Python project with this template, run:

```sh
uvx copier copy gh:superlinear-ai/substrate path/to/local/repository
```

### Update your Python project

To update your Python project to the latest template version, run:

```sh
uvx copier update --exclude src/ --exclude tests/
```

### Release a new version of your Python project

If you have enabled [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), you can create a new version tag and update `CHANGELOG.md` based on your commit messages with:

```sh
git checkout main
cz bump
git push origin main --tags
```

## üç™ Migrating from Cookiecutter

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project was formerly known as `Poetry Cookiecutter` and was based on [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) and [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter). We will continue to support the original Cookiecutter-based template side by side with the new Copier-based template. However, we do encourage users to upgrade to the new Copier-based template by following the instructions below.

To migrate a project from Cookiecutter to Copier, follow these steps:

1. In your project repository, run:

    ```sh
    # Create a new branch
    git checkout -b rescaffold

    # Remove unnecessary files
    rm -f .cruft.json poetry.lock
    
    # Rescaffold the project without changing src/ and tests/
    uvx copier copy --overwrite --exclude src/ --exclude tests/ gh:superlinear-ai/substrate .
    ```

2. Review the changes to `pyproject.toml` and reinsert your project's dependencies.
3. Review the changes to `README.md` and reinsert your project's documentation.
4. Commit and push all changes with:

    ```sh
    # Stage all changes
    git add .

    # Commit the staged changes
    git commit -m "build: upgrade scaffolding"

    # Push the committed changes
    git push origin rescaffold
    ```

5. Create a PR from your branch, review it, and merge it!
